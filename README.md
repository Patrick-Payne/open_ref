## open_ref ##

Script I use to quickly pull up reference material (e.g. from a directory of
pdfs). Work in progress. Currently just searches the working directory for a
matching filename, and opens it in evince.

# Possible future features: #
 * Incomplete or fuzzy searching.
 * Keep a database of search hits in a dictionary to speed common searches.
 * Adding tags and other metadata.
 * More than just PDFs (text files, html, evernote).
